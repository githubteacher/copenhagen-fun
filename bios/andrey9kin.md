##Git and GitHub Experience
I'm using Git since 2010 and GitHub since 2012. Was leading ClearCase to Git migration in different departments back in Ericsson, now helping with ClearCase to Git migration to several customers of Praqma. I wrote plugins for Gerrit and BitBucket, contributed (just a documentation fix) to pygit2. So somewhat advanced.
##Teaching Experience
Teaching Git for 4+ years (live and online classes), teaching Jenkins for 3+ years, teaching CI/CD 2+ years
##Development Experience
C/C++, Java, Python. Mostly tools development
##Languages
I'm teaching in English. Currently I'm getting up to speed with Swedish so eventually I hope to be able to teach in Swedish
##Self-Assessment
All that you get when running git --help as well as different administration commands such as reflog, gc, filter-branch, cat-file, ls-tree and so on
